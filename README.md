## Step 2: Create Tools Just by Chatting With AI

Prompt your AI IDE to create the tools for you in chat. **Make sure to include `./.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc`** in the context. (Included by default only in Cursor). 

For example:

```
Please create a tool that fetches the transcripts from a YouTube video. @workflow.mdc
```

Answer the clarifying questions and keep iterating until the tools are created and working as expected.
